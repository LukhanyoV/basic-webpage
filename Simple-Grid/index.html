                    <p class="heyShorty">The Slave Lodge was built in 1679, making it the second oldest existing 
                        colonial structure of the Cape Colony, today known as Cape Town. 
                        The building was used as a slave lodge until 1811 when it was changed 
                        into government offices by the new British colonial authorities. 
                        Slave Lodge is a museum, managed by Iziko Museums of South Africa. 
                        It became a cultural history museum in 1966, exhibiting mainly the material 
                        culture of the descendents of the Dutch and British colonists.

                    <img src="./static/media/castle-of-good-hope.jpeg" alt="" class="temp">
                    <p class="heyShorty">Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest surviving building 
                        in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life 
                        at the Cape from approximately 1679. The Castle was, however, not the first fort 
                        to be built at the Cape. A quadrangular (four-pointed) fort was built after the 
                        arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652 where the Grand Parade and the main Post Office 
                        are situated today. The paint used on the walls during restoration, is whitewash 
                        mixed with a coloring agent. The condition of the paint is not due to bad 
                        workmanship, but to the lack of moisture-resistant methods used during the 
                        construction of the Castle.

                    <img src="./static/media/city-hall.jpeg" alt="" class="temp">
                    <p class="heyShorty">
                        The building was designed as the result of a public competition, 
                        the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, 
                        with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott. 
                        Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported 
                        from Europe. On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, 
                        Nelson Mandela made his first public speech from the balcony of Cape Town City 
                        Hall. On 24 July 2018, a statue of Nelson Mandela on the balcony overlooking the 
                        Grand Parade was unveiled. It was on the same spot where he made a speech when 
                        he was released from prison on 11 February 1990. A 3D computer model of the 
                        Nelson Mandela Statue was also created. 
                        The 3D model is based on terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry.
